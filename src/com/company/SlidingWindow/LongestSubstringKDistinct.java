Problem Statement #
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring in it with no more than K distinct characters.

You can assume that K is less than or equal to the length of the given string.

Example 1:
Input: String="araaci", K=2
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest substring with no more than '2' distinct characters is "araa".

Example 2:
Input: String="araaci", K=1
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest substring with no more than '1' distinct characters is "aa".

Example 3:
Input: String="cbbebi", K=3
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest substrings with no more than '3' distinct characters are "cbbeb" & "bbebi".

/*
TIME COMPLEXITY: O(N)
The above algorithm’s time complexity will be O(N), where N is the number of characters in the input string.
The outer for loop runs for all characters, and the inner while loop processes each character only once;
therefore, the time complexity of the algorithm will be O(N+N), which is asymptotically equivalent to O(N).


SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(K)
The algorithm’s space complexity is O(K), as we will be storing a maximum of K+1 characters in the HashMap.
