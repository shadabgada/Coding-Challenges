/*
Time complexity #
Since, in each step, the number of subsets doubles as we add each element to all the existing subsets,
therefore, we will have a total of O(2^N) subsets, where āNā is the total number of elements in the input set.
And since we construct a new subset from an existing set,
therefore, the time complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N*2^N).

Space complexity #
All the additional space used by our algorithm is for the output list. Since we will have a total of O(2^N)  subsets,
and each subset can take up to O(N) space, therefore, the space complexity of our algorithm will be O(N*2^N)
